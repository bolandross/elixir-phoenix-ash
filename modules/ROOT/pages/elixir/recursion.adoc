## Recursions
indexterm:["Recursion"]

Recursion is a fundamental concept in functional programming. If you're familiar with loops in other programming languages (like `for` or `while` loops), recursion serves a similar purpose in Elixir. It allows you to perform a task repeatedly, but rather than using a loop, recursion involves a function calling itself.

A recursive function is a function that solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. To prevent infinite recursion, there must be one or more base cases where the function does not call itself.

Let's break this down with a couple of simple examples.

### Recursion Example: Countdown
indexterm:["Recursion", "Countdown example"]

Let's imagine we want to create a countdown. Here's a simple recursive function that achieves this:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> defmodule Example do
...>   def countdown(1) do <1>
...>     IO.puts "1" <2>
...>   end
...>
...>   def countdown(n) when is_integer(n) and n > 1 do <3>
...>     IO.puts Integer.to_string(n) <4>
...>     countdown(n - 1) <5>
...>   end
...> end

iex> Example.countdown(4) <6>
4
3
2
1
:ok
----

<1> This is the base case: when `countdown/1` is called with the argument `1`, this function matches.
<2> We print `1` to STDOUT using `IO.puts`.
<3> If `countdown/1` is called with an integer greater than `1` (we don't want negative input here), this function matches.
<4> We convert the integer to a string using `Integer.to_string(n)` and print it.
<5> The function calls itself, but with `n` decreased by 1 - this is the recursive step.
<6> When we test the function, it correctly counts down from `4` to `1`.

The countdown function keeps calling itself, each time reducing the initial number by one, until it reaches `1`, at which point it stops, thus preventing infinite recursion.

### Recursion Example: Summing a List
indexterm:["Recursion", "Sum example"]

Here's another example where we calculate the sum of a list of integers using recursion:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> defmodule Example do
...>   def sum([]) do <1>
...>     0
...>   end
...>
...>   def sum([head | tail]) do <2>
...>     head + sum(tail) <3>
...>   end
...> end

iex> Example.sum([10, 8, 12, 150]) <4>
180
----
<1> The base case: the sum of an empty list is `0`.
<2> We pattern match a list and split it into a `head` (the first element) and a `tail` (the remaining elements).
<3> We add the `head` to the result of the recursive call, which computes the sum of the `tail`.
<4> The function correctly computes the sum of the list.

### Recursion Example: Transforming a List
indexterm:["Recursion", "List transformation example"]

You can use recursion to transform every element of a list. Let's assume we want to double the value of every element of a list:

[source,elixir]
----
iex> defmodule Example do
...>   def double([]) do <1>
...>     []
...>   end
...>
...>   def double([head | tail]) do
...>     [head * 2 | double(tail)] <2>
...>   end
...> end

iex> Example.double([10, 5, 999])
[20, 10, 1998]
----
<1> Base case: An empty list results in an empty list.
<2> We double the `head` and concatenate it with the result of the recursive call, which doubles the elements of the `tail`.

### Tackling Recursion

Unless you are doing this every day, you will get to problems where you know
that recursion is a good solution, but you just can't think of a good recursion
for it. That is normal. Don't worry.

I used to say that https://www.google.com and
https://stackoverflow.com were your friends. They still are but ChatGPT and Github Copilot have made our lives as programmers to much easier. Ask them. No embarrassment!

During this book, we will work with recursions. So you'll get a better feeling for
it.
